Among ENT (Ear-Nose-Throat) oropharyngeal cancer are evolving at a high speed, especially in Northern countries, and affect predominantly young male patients with no or not excessive history of smoking or drinking. Also, an increase of ENT cancers due to Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is observed. The HPV is also found in the majority of cervix cancer and vaccination campaigns against it are now conducted. The oropharyngeal HPV+ cancers have a better prognosis certainly due to the action of the micro-environment. The micro-environment corresponds to all immune cells around the tumor cells. There are different techniques to find the presence of HPV in the cancer including in situ hybridisation. Because little is known about the behavior of these cancer, researchers and pathologists struggle to determine severity criteria and prognostic factors.

Here is some research we did regarding the challange
