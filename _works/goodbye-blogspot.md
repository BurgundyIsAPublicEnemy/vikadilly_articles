I am making the switch permanent because my readers preferred if I hosted it here.

I don't really plan on moving ALL the stuf from the old blog, or any of the stuff from Project1983 here because that stuff is old and I want to start fresh and new.

Blogspot is great, but it's kinda old and clunky. And all the nice blogging tools are too pricey or too... much. So really looking forward to this new set up with Git.
