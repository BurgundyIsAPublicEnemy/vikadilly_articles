Hello everyone! I made an earlier post called: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tj98is/i_am_a_programmer_whos_looking_to_mentor_people/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tj98is/i_am_a_programmer_whos_looking_to_mentor_people/) where I asked people to offer me a chance to mentor them given it's something I wanted to personally get better at.

And man, did you answer. 200+ replies later, I only got through about 50 of them and finally, I only got around mentoring 8 of them formally (they were the first ones to reach out.) If I didn't reply to you, I am so sorry: I really tried my best to get around it. But it's kinda tough answering questions / reviewing code / sending out good vibes to everyone when you have a full-time job + life!

That being said, I learned a lot from you too and I wanted to take some time to share some commonly asked questions, statistics and tell you about what it's like to mentor random Redditors with my system that I came up with.

- * Disclaimer - these are just my takes on these questions. If you have a totally different take, feel free to drop your answers too **

**Question 1:** What programming language should I learn first as a beginner?

This one's tricky cause programming languages are more like tools. And you can learn A LOT of them too cause different tools do different things really well. So if you are really drawn into hardware, C actually might be a good place to start since you can really explore that passion of yours. Or does data science take your fancy? Python or R for sure! Basically, ask yourself: what about programming / computers, do I find so appealing? And then do some research on the language that is dominant in that specific area. And pick that.

If your draw into the field was the salaries, stick with something like Python, JavaScript, Ruby or Java. They're really widely used in many companies, and you don't need to worry about things like pointers or segmentation faults (like in C) if you have to do a technical interview.

Or be an absolute mad lad and exclusively code in Assembly (I am looking at you Roller Coaster Tycoon dev) - experimentation and how it feels goes a far way here.

**Question 2:** I am going to graduate and I don't hear back from any of my internships/jobs etc. ! Help!

I consulted my friend who works in HR at a tech company for this one and it's super tricky but the gist of it is the game's changed big time - there are tons of great candidates (like you) on the market ATM but some places are looking specifically for someone with experience or with a certain fit. Sometimes, it really comes down to something special for a candidate like a cool side project or a referral that allows the HR member in charge of their application to defend it. That's just how it is sometimes and you shouldn't feel discouraged at all from this. On their end, they have so many applications to go through so it is really tough!

**Question 3:** What are things outside programming I can do to get better prepared for software work?

Software is a collaborative process with people who own different parts of the projects (and are passionate about.) So just developing a learning mindset is so important as you might have to explore new technology to help deliver some functionality or whatever - I think you'll find a lot of people who already work full time have this mindset and it's great to see people collaborate on their learning. The industry moves very fast in this regard - you can get a certification too to help sell your knowledge on a certain area (like an AWS certification.) Secondly, learning concepts like Agile etc. can help you understand how your new team will work and the ceremonies which keep the flow going and keep you accountable.

**What is it like to mentor random strangers?**

Some people in my earlier post asked me to give them an update on what it was like to do this. As I mentioned earlier, I have a very structured way of doing a mentorship which is where I try to not "teach" people coding as much as I ask them to set realistic goals for themselves, tell me how they'll achieve it and I step in whenever they need it.

My goal here is not to get people interview and job ready but to make people capable and passionate engineers... in my own way. Time will tell if this actually works.

This is actually the same exact method I was put on when I joined the industry! I've kept the group rather small because some of them informed me of some big Discord groups which broke down into just meme places, which is chill and fine but not what I had in mind. If someone who is capable of the mentoring can, tons of people here would appreciate it (either check out my earlier post or ask around) - I really enjoy my current group. They're enthusiastic, have given me excellent advice (like doing pomadero) and I've placed them on "mini" work experiences doing open source work and networking with people.

If this is something you'd really enjoy being a part of, feel free to reach out - I will also be diving into my DMs from my earlier post to find people but hey - if you let your intention be known here, then someone who can mentor you might!

**Closing thoughts**

If you enjoyed / learned / angrily frothed @ something from this post, I plan on sharing more things.

I got a few questions to ask you regarding some thoughts I've had when talking to a lot of you about your experience I'd love more input regarding as to help me... better understand what it's like to learn to program. I'd really appreciate your time/input: [https://forms.gle/mfSPxTJwm4EhHjxb8](https://forms.gle/mfSPxTJwm4EhHjxb8)

Aite peace!
