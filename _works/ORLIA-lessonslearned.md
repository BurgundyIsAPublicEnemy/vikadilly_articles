The dust has settled. We won. I'm going to write my first academic paper. It's all very exciting but I think it's time to take a look back for a bit so we can go forward.

## Lesson 1: I absolutely LOVE Pytorch
OK, I've been a Tensorflow advocate since I started learning but oh my god. PyTorch just... makes so much more sense for my brain. Things here feel actually program-ey and I feel in total control on what's going on here.

That being said, TF came on the clutch when it came for rapid prototyping so I think a mix of the two in the future is where I stand

## Lesson 2: The water is fine out here
One of the things I struggled with early on is applying ideas I'd learn on a whiteboard at university and take it back to the problem. I feel what finally clicked here for me was seeing it all from the start to end. 

When you learn an idea on a whiteboard, it's often very specific to that one concept and without context of the overall problem where you'd apply it, it's quite hard to apply it. Doing this challenge meant I was forced to overcome my fear of playing around with Tensor sizes in order to get the data to load properly, had to overcome my fear of using image data because I felt uncomfortable with CNN cause it looked intimidating on the whiteboard and generally, just afraid of doing anything in the project other than the actual modelling.

I feel having gone through the full 9 yards, I have really challenged myself

## Lesson 3: Deep Learning isn't always the answer 
I always had a feeling that jumping right into Deep Learning models for any problem wasn't always gonna work out. I feel vindicated here: if we hadn't tried solving for certain relationships between engineered features or calculating the lower possible bounds when playing with the MAPE metric, I think our progress would've been a lot worse off. I feel I should make it a thing for my Maths to get much better cause I enjoyed solving these "weird" puzzles, which turned out to be pretty useful in the end. 

In the end anyways, we ended up breaking the contest cause of a linear regression - oops. 

## Lesson 4: I like working with nerds from other places 
It was incredible to work with people just as passionate about their field as I was on mine. I feel that passion is a common language we nerds can use to communicate to other people on.

## Lesson 5: I enjoyed doing this project even though I didn't get paid
It was so different from work projects. And seeing the biologists talk about the results and explain what we had done was amazing. I think I like doing stuff like this. I think in the future, I'd like to do LOFT projects based on deep learning and share them!
