First off, this post is 90% explanation and 10% apology cause I am about to radically change the roadmap views on https://puddn.xyz 

My goal has always been to bridge the gap between people wanting to learn to code and actually getting opportunities to do it.

One of the features I want to build with Puddn to help me do this is comprehensive educational roadmaps which are built using free resources on the Internet. 
From my conversations with my community, I have come to understand that people don't really struggle with learning to code in order to break 
int the tech industry - that isn't the hard bit. 
The hard bit is turning that learning into a piece of portfolio / networking crutch so you can impress and get your first step in. Which is why I don't 
record my own content for Puddn. In terms of content we provide on the website, it's in the form of live show technical seminars and Ask An HR session. 

However, if you want to deliver a LinkedIn for early tech careers that can bootcamp people into their first tech job, you have to 
provide some kind of educational content. Here is the breakdown of what goes into a roadmap: 

1) Chatting to real industry developers and companies
2) Informal consultation sessions to identify in demand skills
3) Identifying resources on the Internet to help build these skills
4) Beta Testing 
5) Releasing, go back to the top and Iterate

# Step 1
As someone who's in the industry, I am so grateful to the excellent mentorship I have recieved both in my company and out of my company. 
This gives me access to a wealth of advice which I try to build a framework around when writing the roadmaps, access to recruitement and outreach 
events like AWS Summit where I can talk to other developers from top tech companies and having been the guy who sits on the other side of the 
interview table reviewing CVs, I also have personal experience to draw on. 

# Step 2 
I grew up with friends who went on to work at FAANGs and recruitment. For this stage, I literally just take them out for dinner or something, then we hop on a call 
and write the roadmaps on Google Jamboard. Sounds simple but we keep it as MVP as we can.

# Step 3
I scour the Internet for free content. I keep it very minimal as my goal is to build autonomous engineers who know how to look up tutorials themselves, like 
they would at a job.

I have some rules when selecting content and reviewing: 
1) No Medium articles / paid articles - not everyone can access them so no.
2) Videos are good, but mix it with articles - not everyone likes video content (can do better in this regard)
3) Limit the Wikipedia artcles - I only bring it up for explanation for concepts
4) Videos and content should lead to a rabbit hole - that way, you can explore concepts to your hearts content

# Step 4
Beta testing with small subsection of the userbase - I will hop on calls with people and show them it, let them play around and make adjustments accordingly.
It's good data in helping me make a better app and I keep an eye out on their progress, supporting them when they need it

I do genuinely love talking to people who use the app. Beginners have such a wonder for tech that I feel I have lost over the years due to server maintenance tasks 
and bug fixes, but this has also resulted in me having to come to terms with my own biases when hiring, which I hope gets ironed out when I talk to more people about 
their experiences.

# Step 5
Go back to Step 1
