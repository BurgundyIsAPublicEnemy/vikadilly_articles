# Life update: I am a bit tired atm!
I have a terrible habit: I just don't know when to relax. I have a pretty hectic schedule as it is which I managed to put to work only through fine tuning time windows.

I feel like if I have some free where I am not doing anything... I feel like it's time wasted. Like that's time that could've gone towards a side project... or a time I could've painted something new.

It doesn't help that I am going to personal problems currently. The way I deal with that feeling is by shoving as much stuff as I can within the day. Whether it's extra programming, or a life class or gym, something has to happen or I'll go crazy.

Does anyone else ever feel like that too? If you do, let me know!

I feel like a mental health day is in order perhaps.

## Work
Trying my best to be useful and get up to speed but I can really only do my best here... Beginning to wonder a bit about my own ability sometimes, especially when debugging docker containers

## ORL/IA
It's going well! We got our baseline off. Just need to grade it. It's tough doing the community stuff too but jsut gotta keep going.

## Tiny Dancer (?)
I put the project on hold since I am trying to get over some stuff which makes learning Linear Algebra to do this a bit harder. But once again, we keep moving!

### TODO: 
* Read some papers and get that #mlin140 thing I wanted to do running
* Update the Works section of this blog
* Start maybe uploading more art here
