# Challenging myself in the unfamiliar
Cancer is awful. You didn't need a blog post to know that. I have been working in financial services for a while and I have always wanted to know: how can I use my skills and learnings to help make the world a better place? 

A good old uni friend had introduced me to JOGL (link here: https://jogl.io/) which is this super cool open science platform where people around the world team up to solve difficult problems through crowd sourcing and open source software.

Definitely something I'd like to get involved with!

## My role so far
I am the leader of the ORLIAN project (https://app.jogl.io/project/836) working with wonderful domain experts and other data scientists. TBH, I am probably the most inexperienced here so it's a great opportunity to learn and work with others.

## Challenge 1 - The Domain
As I said before, I come from a finance background. I literally know nothing about biology, let alone cancer (beyond a GCSE level.) So coming into this, and seeing how to work with the images is a massive challenge. 

### How I am resolving this...
I can code. Or at least I think I can. So, I overcome my difficulty by pairing up with domain experts who can "identify" and tell me about strategies they are aware of. 

It's my job then to follow up and read up on the material. I try to convert the tough material into a language I understand (I blank out the jargon, or right them in terms I get.)

So far, this has been working well. RN, I have been shown an implementation of KNN with breast cancer images so it's something I am looking at.

## Challenge 2 - Building a community
There are quite a few active members in the project now but it wasn't always like that in the first few days. I used sources like Reddit and Discord to help find people.

There's a lot of work to be done to keep going but initial feedback from newer guys is:
* Better visibility on what the project is about
* Why people should get involved
* More visiblity on where ORLIAn will go

I am working on a better roadmap with the challenge team and hopefully, we can put a shift on places like Kaggle and internally in my company to get more people

I will make more posts but here is to a good session with the project!
