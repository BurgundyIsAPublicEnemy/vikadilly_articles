# Me and self learning
I didn't realise I was a self directed learner until my third year at college. I met probably the hardest worker I'd ever met in my life, and after spending time with them, picked up their methods.

Over lockdown, I challenged myself to study Statistics to college level so I tackled the OpenStatistics course and hundreds of pages and other books / classes later, I had well laid out notes, problems from each chapter solved. I was contributing to open source initiatives and really started to fall in love with my work.

Here are some tips I use to help study:

## Start with a goal
Keep it simple and realistic. If you are self learning, you are probably gonna be here for the long mile. You have a limited pool of time and energy, and over X time, you will need to estimate how far you can get with stuying a certain topic. This estimate, should be your goal. 

Review goals regularly when the time is met. Ideally, you *want* to miss goals early on so you know the present extent of your powers.

If you meet goals early... that means you are stronger than your estimates and you need to adjust. The true is for the vice versa.

Keep your goals measureable and it'll help you be more objective

## Get a feedback loop going
There is a saying: surround yourself with people of who you want to be. A big part as to why I joined ORL/IA was because of the team: it was full of research scientists, data people and most importantly, hard workers with lots of expertise. 

Regularly ask for feedback, and act on it. 

## Outcomes, artifacts and showpieces
A hot take, but learning is a lot better when you have to show for it. Aim to produce pieces of whatever you are learning rather than just reading through the content. And make sure you are doing something substanial. 

Keep a blog and share your learnings. Write a data hosting service to learn how the cloud works. Do open source work. It all adds up and you can take a look back it and remember: yeah, that's how you do it.
