I feel like Aunt Agony at this point. I have worked in the industry for a couple of years now, and I am looking to get better at understanding what it takes to learn to program so I can be a better mentor as well as learn some things about myself.

I currently mentor 10 people via a Discord channel so I get a really good insight into the process. I am still working through the messages and answering questions (the good news is only have 107 more to go!) but here are some hot ones I wanted to share here.

**Question 1: What's wrong with my CV / LinkedIn profile?** 
I have actually got quite a few of these. I am not an HR person and everyone's resume is so different and can be improved in different ways, not to mention I have my own biases when it comes to my decision on hiring people. What I can do is give you advice on how to get feedback on your resume and the answer is to simply just send it to companies and see if they respond etc.

When you break down a CV / LinkedIn profile, its function is to back your intent to join a company and the output of its success is whether you get a callback. With that in mind, the rejection is a form of feedback - think about the company you are applying and think about the scale of applications it gets. A rejection means you just gotta tweak something and try again. 

Maybe it might be worth applying to a smaller place where you are more likely to get some feedback in some kind of way or form, or just post profiles at appropriate groups. Of course, you don't need to listen to all the advice but these things are iterative, you will get there (eventually)

**Question 2: I am self-taught and have no experience. No one will hire me cause I have no experience. What can I do?** 
The answer is actually a two word one: signal boost. This means getting involved with open source projects, becoming a community leader, developing a blog / starting a Twitter following / and creating an email list, and bragging about all your achievements on LinkedIn etc. - literally doing anything that has some public output. You gotta remember: you are competing with people with CS degrees, people with PhDs etc. sometimes so if I were to Google your name, what would it tell me? 

The reason I start with this part of the advice is cause it’s becoming more common knowledge that to get ahead, you should message a recruiter at the company. The issue with knowledge that gets more common is literally everyone is doing it now - so once again, you need to treat yourself as a product and be marketable. 

Furthermore, if you get involved more and more with the community, you can eventually develop some kind of relationship with someone who’d be willing to give you a referral. This is the holy grail of cutting through but the only way you do this is you have to get involved

**Question 3: Would you like to join my app / company ? (I have been asked this 3 times so far.)**

You might be thinking: what does this question have to do with you? And that’s the thing: during these posts, never once have I actually proven what I have said what I actually say I am - I haven’t posted my degree, or my work badge proving my credentials and yet, I have been asked 3 times this over the last 2 weeks. 

The reason I want to share this is EXACTLY what I mean by community engagement to help signal boost - just putting your voice, thoughts, sharing, helping can really help people find you. Make it easier for businesses who want great people like you by finding your voice - it makes the difference :) 

As for an actual answer to this question: the answer is Thank you very much, but No - personally, I really enjoy working at my current company and my job. But best of luck finding people! 

**Question 4: Where is that promised Discord server and roadmap?!** 

I’m working on it! It hasn’t been easy: I have had 200+ requests and I can personally only mentor 10 people. So million dollar question before I make it fully public is: how do I make sure people actually learn and become better engineers? And I think I’ve narrowed down what needs to be done to make this community a success. 

I didn’t think a roadmap was enough - if it was good enough, the [i.am.ai](http://i.am.ai) roadmap should’ve made me personally the greatest and most desirable data scientist but it hasn’t. So something was missing.

Through my in-depth conversations with around 60+ of you, excluding my mentees, I think I understand better why learning programming is hard - I don’t think the technical stuff is the hard part, it’s mostly a mix of lack of motivation, guidance, understanding and experience of where to go to learn something. Very rarely has the question “What is wrong with this code ?” have nothing to do with understanding the framework you are using (tutorials online can help) or StackOverFlow cannot answer. In that event, there are three skills I’ve narrowed down which allow you to become professional: autonomy, accountability, and the ability to develop a feedback loop.

I don’t want to help people land jobs cause people get jobs by being great engineers - I want to make great engineers who can solve problems and are passionate about their craft. These are the types of people I would love to learn from and I am happy to say my mentees seem like they are going that way - all they need is just a bit of a push and a heads up at what the big picture is and off they go. I’ve learned a lot about learning myself from them (like about the Pomadero method when doing LeetCode etc.) 

That being said. 

I think I am ready to start opening the community and the roadmaps to more people. I have hosted the roadmap as as web app. After you start working through the roadmap, you will be sorted into an accountability group with people of the same level of skill. The roadmap isn’t a tutorial as much as it’s a big picture of your career, the skills surrounding your desired career and some information on how to reach some competency at that skill. The only way you can prove your skill is by uploading evidence - be it code on Github or a live demo. Once you do that, you will receive feedback from either myself (and some other engineers), the community as a whole and a accountability group. Furthermore, your progress and interest on the roadmap will allow us to find you suitable open source projects to start networking and developing a community on. I hope this will teach people to become autonomous engineers. I hope you use the roadmap to find what you are passionate in, and your community that will help you carry you forward better than I could ever.

If you are interested in joining this community and roadmap, the roadmap can be found here: 
Once you create an account and log in, you will see a link to the Discord group on the bottom right. If you try joining in without having an account on the app, you can’t get in - this is cause the Discord channel has been set up to support the objectivity of the roadmap. It would probably make no sense otherwise but if you want a community, there are plenty out there!
